# Chicken Disease Detection

This project focuses on developing an image classification model to detect diseases in chickens based on images of chicken droppings. The model leverages a transfer learning approach using the MobileNetV2 architecture to achieve reliable performance while keeping the computational cost relatively low.

## Machine Learning Overview

The model was trained using a supervised learning approach with labeled images of chicken droppings. Transfer learning was implemented by fine-tuning a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to adapt it to the specific classification task. This strategy helps reduce training time while maintaining strong classification accuracy.
